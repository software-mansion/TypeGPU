## *prepareDispatch*

The `prepareDispatch` function simplifies running simple computations on the GPU.
Under the hood, it wraps the callback in a `TgpuFn`, creates a compute pipeline, and returns a dispatch function to execute it.

This can help reduce serialization overhead when initializing buffers with data.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu, { prepareDispatch } from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const root = await tgpu.init();

const Boid = d.struct({
  index: d.u32,
  pos: d.vec3f,
});

// buffer of 2048 Boids
const boidsMutable = root.createMutable(d.arrayOf(Boid, 2048));

const dispatch = prepareDispatch(root, (x) => {
  'kernel';
  const boidData = Boid({ index: x, pos: d.vec3f() });
  boidsMutable.$[x] = boidData;
});
// run callback for each x in range 0..2047
dispatch(2048);
```

:::note
Remember to mark the callback with `'kernel'` directive to let TypeGPU know that this function is TGSL.
:::

The returned dispatch function can be called multiple times.
Since the pipeline is reused, there’s no additional overhead for subsequent calls.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu, { prepareDispatch } from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
const root = await tgpu.init();
// ---cut---
const data = root.createMutable(d.arrayOf(d.u32, 8), [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]);

const doubleUp = prepareDispatch(root, (x) => {
  'kernel';
  data.$[x] *= 2;
});

doubleUp(8);
doubleUp(8);
doubleUp(4);

// no need to await `doubleUp()` because the command encoder
// will queue the read after `doubleUp` anyway
console.log(await data.read()); // [0, 8, 16, 24, 16, 20, 24, 28]
```

The callback can have up to three arguments (dimensions).
Buffer initialization commonly uses random number generators.
For that, you can use the [`@typegpu/noise`](TypeGPU/ecosystem/typegpu-noise) library.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu, { prepareDispatch } from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
// ---cut---
import { randf } from '@typegpu/noise';

const root = await tgpu.init();

// buffer of 1024x512 floats
const waterLevelMutable = root.createMutable(
  d.arrayOf(d.arrayOf(d.f32, 512), 1024),
);

prepareDispatch(root, (x, y) => {
  'kernel';
  randf.seed2(d.vec2f(x, y).div(1024));
  waterLevelMutable.$[x][y] = 10 + randf.sample();
})(1024, 512);
// callback will be called for x in range 0..1023 and y in range 0..511

// (optional) read values in JS
console.log(await waterLevelMutable.read());
```

It is highly recommended NOT to use `dispatch` for:

- More complex compute shaders.
When using `dispatch`, it is impossible to switch bind groups or to change workgroup sizes.
For such cases, a manually created pipeline would be more suitable.

- Small calls.
Usually, for small data the shader creation and dispatch is more costly than serialization.
Small buffers can be more efficiently initialized with `buffer.write()` method.

:::note
The default workgroup sizes are:

- `[1, 1, 1]` for 0D dispatches,
- `[256, 1, 1]` for 1D dispatches,
- `[16, 16, 1]` for 2D dispatches,
- `[8, 8, 4]` for 3D dispatches.

The callback is not called if the global invocation id of a thread would exceed the size in any dimension.
