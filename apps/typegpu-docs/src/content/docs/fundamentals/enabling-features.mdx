title: Enabling GPU Features
description: How to declare and activate WebGPU device features in TypeGPU.
---

Some GPU capabilities, such as timestamp queries or subgroup operations, must be explicitly requested before use. TypeGPU passes your configuration directly to the WebGPU API, with a convenient extension for marking features as optional.

:::tip
For a complete list of feature names, consult the [WebGPU specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#gpufeaturename).

## Requesting features

When initializing TypeGPU, include `requiredFeatures` and/or `optionalFeatures` in the `device` descriptor:

```ts
const root = await tgpu.init({
  adapter: {
    powerPreference: 'high-performance',
  },
  device: {
    // These features must be supported or initialization will fail
    requiredFeatures: [
      'timestamp-query',
      'subgroup-operations',
    ],
    // These features will be enabled if available; missing ones are ignored
    optionalFeatures: [
      'shader-f16',
    ],
  },
  // …other TypeGPU options…
});
```

* **`requiredFeatures: GPUFeatureName[]`**
  All listed features must be supported by the GPU; otherwise `requestDevice()` rejects.

* **`optionalFeatures: GPUFeatureName[]`**
  The GPU will enable supported features and ignore unsupported ones without error.

## Verifying availability

After `tgpu.init()` resolves, you can check which features are enabled using the `enabledFeatures` property on the root object:

```ts
if (root.enabledFeatures.has('timestamp-query')) {
  console.log('Timestamp queries are available');
}
if (root.enabledFeatures.has('subgroup-operations')) {
  console.log('Subgroup operations are enabled');
}
```
