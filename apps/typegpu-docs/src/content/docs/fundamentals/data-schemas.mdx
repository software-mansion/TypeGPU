title: Data Schemas
---

Writing a GPU program usually involves sharing data between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU), in this case between JavaScript and WGSL.
Any misalignments or misinterpretations of data can lead to bugs that are hard to debug (No `console.log` on the GPU, I am afraid).
While data is strongly typed in WGSL shaders, we give up that type safety completely when writing and reading data in JavaScript/TypeScript.
This is precisely what TypeGPU data types help with.

:::note
Complex data types such as structs require particular byte alignment and padding between fields. TypeGPU does this automatically when transforming JS values into binary.
:::

## Examples

Let's look at some examples of defining custom data types using the `typegpu/data` module. If you're familiar with [Zod](https://zod.dev/), then this style of schema definitions may already seem familiar.

```ts twoslash
// @moduleResolution: bundler
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const Circle = d.struct({
  centerPos: d.vec3i,
  radius: d.f32,
});

type Circle = d.Infer<typeof Circle>;
//   ^?

const redCircle: Circle = {
  centerPos: d.vec3i(2, 4, 0),
  radius: 0.2,
};
```

By defining the `Circle` struct in TypeScript via TypeGPU, in a similar way to how we would in WGSL, we gain access to its TypeScript type
definition, which we can use to validate our data values. When reading from or writing data to the GPU, the type of the JavaScript value
is inferred automatically, and it's enforced by TypeScript. Thanks to that, whenever we mistakenly set or assume a wrong value for an object,
we get a type error, avoiding unnecessary debugging afterwards. That's a big improvement to the development process.

```ts twoslash
// @moduleResolution: bundler
// @errors: 2740 2322 2741 2339

import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const Circle = d.struct({
  centerPos: d.vec3i,
  radius: d.f32,
});

type Circle = d.Infer<typeof Circle>;

// ---cut---
const redCircle1: Circle = {
  centerPos: d.vec2i(2, 4), 
  radius: 0.2,
};

const redCircle2: Circle = {
  centerPos: d.vec3i(2, 4, 0), 
  radius: "0.2",
};

const redCircle3: Circle = {
  centerPos: d.vec3i(2, 4, 0), 
};

const diam = redCircle1.rad * 2;
```

Defined data structures automatically measure and hold information about their memory layout parameters, which is useful for writing to and reading data from the GPU.

```ts twoslash
// @moduleResolution: bundler

import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import { sizeOf, alignmentOf } from 'typegpu/data';

const Circle = d.struct({
  centerPos: d.vec3i,
  radius: d.f32,
});

type Circle = d.Infer<typeof Circle>;

// ---cut---
sizeOf(Circle) // 16
alignmentOf(Circle) // 16
```

TypeGPU data types are essential for the library's automated data marshalling capabilities.

## Scalars, Vectors & Matrices

There are a few ways to categorize numeric data-types in TypeGPU.
- Characteristic (floating-point `f`, signed int `i`, unsigned int `u`).
- Size in bits (8, 16, 32).
- Number of components (1, 2, 3, 4, ...).

`d.f32`, `d.i32` and `d.u32` all represent single-component 32-bit numeric values. When reading/writing values
in JS, they are all seen as just `number`.

Vectors (`d.vec2f`, `d.vec3f`, ...) are interpreted in JS as special objects, which can be created by "calling" the schema
with numeric components, e.g.:
```ts
const v0 = d.vec3f(1.1, 2.5, 3.3); // => vec3f
const v1 = d.vec4u(3, 4, 5, 2); // => vec4u
// ...
```

Matrices work in a similar way.
```ts
const mat0 = d.mat3x3f(
  1.1, 2.5, 3.3,
  1.2, 2.6, 3.4,
  1.3, 2.7, 3.5,
); // => mat3x3f

const mat1 = d.mat2x2f(3, 4, 5, 2); // => mat2x2f

// ...
```

For a comprehensive list of all available schemas, see the [Data Schema Cheatsheet](/TypeGPU/reference/data-schema-cheatsheet).

:::tip
Performing vector and matrix math operations with TypeGPU values is possible due
to a seamless integration with `wgpu-matrix`, which you can [read more about here](/TypeGPU/integration/working-with-wgpu-matrix).

## Structs

Values of different types can be grouped into structs.

```ts 
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const Boid = d.struct({
  position: d.vec3u,
  velocity: d.vec3f,
  color: d.vec4f,
  isActive: d.bool,
});

const boid: d.Infer<typeof Boid> = {
  position: d.vec3u(0, 0, 0),
  velocity: d.vec3f(1, 0.5, 0.5),
  color: d.vec4f(1.0, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0),
  isActive: true,
};
```

Struct schemas adjust the padding and alignment automatically, so that they comply with WebGPU's memory alignment rules.
It is also possible to override default byte alignment and size for particular fields via the `align` and `size ` functions.

```ts 
const Boid = d.struct({
  position: d.align(32, d.vec3u), // Aligned to multiples of 32 bytes
  velocity: d.vec3f,
  color: d.vec4f,
  isActive: d.size(8, d.bool), // Has a minimum size of 8 bytes
});
```

## Arrays

To define arrays of known constant length, use the `d.arrayOf` function. It accepts as arguments the array's elements data type constructor and the length of the array.

```ts
const RecentResults = d.arrayOf(d.f32, 4);

type RecentResults = d.Infer<typeof RecentResults>; // => number[]

const recentResults: RecentResults = [
  1, 0, 0.5, 20
];
```
