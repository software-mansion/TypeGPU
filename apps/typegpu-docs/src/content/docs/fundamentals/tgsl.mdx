:::caution[Experimental]
This feature is under heavy development and is yet to reach stability.
:::

:::note[Requires unplugin-typegpu]
To use TS kernels, you need to install and configure [unplugin-typegpu](/TypeGPU/tooling/unplugin-typegpu).
:::

**TS Kernels** are functions marked with the `'kernel'` directive, picked up by our dedicated build plugin -- [unplugin-typegpu](/TypeGPU/tooling/unplugin-typegpu) and transformed into a format TypeGPU can understand.

```ts twoslash
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as std from 'typegpu/std';

function manhattanDistance(a: d.v3f, b: d.v3f) {
  'tgpu';
  const dx = std.abs(a.x - b.x);
  const dy = std.abs(a.y - b.y);
  const dz = std.abs(a.z - b.z);

  return std.max(dx, std.max(dy, dz));
}
```

TypeGPU already provides a set of standard kernels under `typegpu/std`, which you can use in your own kernels. Our goal is for all kernels to have matching
behavior on the CPU and GPU, which unlocks many possibilities.

There are three main ways to use kernels.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as std from 'typegpu/std';

function manhattanDistance(a: d.v3f, b: d.v3f) {
  'use gpu';
  const dx = std.abs(a.x - b.x);
  const dy = std.abs(a.y - b.y);
  const dz = std.abs(a.z - b.z);

  return std.max(dx, std.max(dy, dz));
}

// ---cut---
// #1) Can be called in JS
const dist = manhattanDistance(d.vec3f(1, 2, 3), d.vec3f(6, 5, 4));

// #2) Executed on the GPU
const root = await tgpu.init();

(root, () => {
  'use gpu';
  manhattanDistance(d.vec3f(1, 2, 3), d.vec3f(6, 5, 4));
}).dispatch();

// #3) Used to generate WGSL
const wgsl = tgpu.resolve({ externals: { manhattanDistance } });
````

The contents of the `wgsl` variable will be the following:

```wgsl
// Generated WGSL
fn manhattanDistance(a: vec3f, b: vec3f) -> f32 {
  let dx = abs(a.x - b.x);
  let dy = abs(a.y - b.y);
  let dz = abs(a.z - b.z);

  return max(dx, max(dy, dz));
}
````

You can already notice a few things about TS Kernels:
- Using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc. is perfectly valid on numbers.
- TS types are properly inferred, feel free to hover over the variables to see their types.
- The generated code closely matches your source code.

## Anatomy of a kernel

:::note
TS kernels are picked up by `unplugin-typegpu` during bundling, their AST is compacted into our custom format called [tinyest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinyest) and injected
into the user code. This metadata is then used to generate equivalent WGSL at runtime efficiently.
:::

:::tip
If you wish for all WGSL generation to happen at build time, combine [unplugin-macros](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-macros) and our [resolve API](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/resolve).
:::

## Usage

Instead of using a WGSL code string, you can pass TGSL to the tgpu function shell as an argument instead.
Functions from the WGSL standard library (*distance, arrayLength, workgroupBarrier, [etc.](https://github.com/software-mansion/TypeGPU/blob/release/packages/typegpu/src/std/index.ts)*) are accessible through the `typegpu/std` entrypoint.
The package also includes functions for vector and matrix operators (*add, eq, lt...*).

```ts
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as std from 'typegpu/std';

const MAX_OBSTACLES = 4;
const obstacles = root
  .createReadonly(d.arrayOf(d.struct({
    center: d.vec2i,
    size: d.vec2i,
    enabled: d.u32,
  }), MAX_OBSTACLES));

const isInsideObstacle = tgpu.fn([d.i32, d.i32], d.bool)((x, y) => {
  for (let obsIdx = 0; obsIdx < MAX_OBSTACLES; obsIdx++) {
    const obs = obstacles.$[obsIdx];
    if (obs.enabled === 0) {
      continue;
    }
    const minX = std.max(0, obs.center.x - d.i32(obs.size.x / 2));
    const maxX = std.min(gridSize, obs.center.x + d.i32(obs.size.x / 2));
    const minY = std.max(0, obs.center.y - d.i32(obs.size.y / 2));
    const maxY = std.min(gridSize, obs.center.y + d.i32(obs.size.y / 2));
    if (x >= minX && x <= maxX && y >= minY && y <= maxY) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
});
```

```ts
import {
  oklabGamutClip,
  oklabGamutClipAlphaAccess,
  oklabGamutClipSlot,
  oklabToLinearRgb,
  oklabToRgb,
} from '@typegpu/color';
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import { any, cos, floor, gt, lt, mul, select, sin } from 'typegpu/std';

const mainFragment = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({
  in: { uv: d.vec2f },
  out: d.vec4f,
})((input) => {
  const hue = layout.$.uniforms.hue;
  const pos = scaleView(input.uv);
  const lab = d.vec3f(
    pos.y,
    mul(pos.x, d.vec2f(cos(hue), sin(hue))),
  );
  const rgb = oklabToLinearRgb(lab);
  const outOfGamut = any(lt(rgb, d.vec3f(0))) || any(gt(rgb, d.vec3f(1)));

  const clipLab = oklabGamutClipSlot.value(lab);
  const color = oklabToRgb(lab);

  const patternScaled = patternSlot.value(input.uv, clipLab) * 0.1 + 0.9;

  return d.vec4f(select(color, mul(patternScaled, color), outOfGamut), 1);
});
```

:::note
When using TGSL, you don't need to explicitly declare function externals with the `$uses` method.
The [TypeGPU Build Plugin](/TypeGPU/tooling/unplugin-typegpu/) automatically extracts all external definitions from the function's AST.
:::

Sometimes, we are unable to recognize functions that are supposed to be TGSL. For that case, we have a *"use gpu"* directive.

```ts
const patternFn = tgpu.fn([d.vec2f], d.f32);

const patternCheckers = patternFn((uv) => {
  'use gpu';
  const suv = floor(mul(20, uv));
  return suv.x + suv.y - 2 * floor((suv.x + suv.y) * 0.5);
});

const patternSolid = patternFn(() => {
  'use gpu';
  return 1;
});
```

## Executing TGSL functions in JS

TGSL-implemented functions can be invoked on the CPU,
as along as they do not use any GPU-exclusive functionalities,
like buffers or textures (regardless of whether they are marked with *"use gpu"* or not).

Keep in mind that you cannot execute entry-point functions in JavaScript.

## What to keep in mind

* **TGSL limitations** --
For a function to be valid TGSL, it must consist only of supported JS syntax (again, see [tinyest-for-wgsl repository](https://github.com/software-mansion/TypeGPU/blob/release/packages/tinyest-for-wgsl/src/parsers.ts)), possibly including references to bound buffers, constant variables defined outside the function, other TGSL functions etc.
This means that, for example, `Math.sqrt(n)` calls will not work on the GPU.
One exception to this is `console.log()`, about which you can read more [here](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/utils/#consolelog).

* **Differences between JS on the CPU and GPU** --
TGSL is developed to work on the GPU the same as on the CPU as much as possible,
however because of the fundamental differences between the JavaScript and WGSL languages, it is not guaranteed to always be the case.

    Currently, the biggest known difference is that vectors, matrices and structs are treated as reference types in JavaScript and value types in WGSL.
That is, on the WGSL side, the assignment operator copies the value instead of the reference, and two different vectors can be equal to each other if only they store the same values, unlike in JS, where they need to point to the same reference.
To somehow alleviate this issue, when passing arguments to tgpu functions on JS side, we perform a deep copy of them (note that in WGSL arguments are immutable by default).

    When using TGSL on the GPU, the behavior is that of WGSL, not JS, as one would expect.
Therefore some WGSL knowledge is still required, even when opting out for TGSL.

* **.value** --
Objects that have different types on the CPU and on the GPU (like buffers, layouts, slots etc.) need to be accessed via the `value` property in TGSL functions (or the `$` property alias).
This is different from how they appear in WGSL-implemented ones.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const root = await tgpu.init();

const bgColor = root.createUniform(d.vec4f, d.vec4f(0.114, 0.447, 0.941, 1));

const fragmentTgsl = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({ out: d.vec4f })(() => {
  return bgColor.$;
//               ^?
});

const fragmentWgsl = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({ out: d.vec4f })`{
  return bgColor;
}
`.$uses({ bgColor });
```

* **Operators** --
JavaScript does not support operator overloading.
This means that, while you can still use operators for numbers,
you have to use supplementary functions from `typegpu/std` (*add, mul, eq, lt, ge...*) for operations involving vectors and matrices.

* **Pointers** --
Since WGSL pointers can only point to a narrow set of items called Storable Types,
TypeGPU tries to dereference pointers used in TGSL automatically when it seems appropriate.
For example, function arguments that are pointers to reference types are passed just as the pointed object.
Pointers to primitive types (numbers and booleans) are currently not supported.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
// ---cut---
const fn = tgpu.fn([d.ptrFn(d.vec3f)], d.vec3f)((ptr) => {
  ptr.x += 1;
//^?
  return ptr;
});
```

* **When to use TGSL instead of WGSL** --
Writing the code using TGSL has a few significant advantages.
It allows defining utils only once and using them both as GPU and CPU functions,
as well as enables complete syntax highlighting and autocomplete in TypeGPU function definitions, leading to a better developer UX.
However, it sometimes might be better to choose WGSL for certain functions.
Since JavaScript doesn't support operator overloading, functions including complex matrix operations can be more readable in WGSL.
Writing WGSL becomes a necessity whenever TGSL does not support some feature or standard library function quite yet.
Luckily, you don't have to choose one or the other for the entire project. It is possible to mix and match WGSL and TGSL at every step of the way.
