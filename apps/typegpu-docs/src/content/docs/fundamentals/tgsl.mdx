This feature is under heavy development and is yet to reach stability.

**TGSL (TypeGPU Shading Language)** is a subset of JavaScript used to define functions that run on the GPU via TypeGPU.
It works by transpiling JavaScript into a compact AST format, called [tinyest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinyest), 
which is then used to generate equivalent WGSL.

You can check the current state of supported JavaScript syntax in the [tinyest-for-wgsl repository](https://github.com/software-mansion/TypeGPU/blob/release/packages/tinyest-for-wgsl/src/parsers.ts).

For the TGSL functions to work, you need to use the dedicated build plugin -- [unplugin-typegpu](/TypeGPU/tooling/unplugin-typegpu).

## Usage

Instead of using a WGSL code string, you can pass TGSL to the tgpu function shell as an argument instead.
Functions from the WGSL standard library (*distance, arrayLength, workgroupBarrier, [etc.](https://github.com/software-mansion/TypeGPU/blob/release/packages/typegpu/src/std/index.ts)*) are accessible through the `typegpu/std` endpoint. 
The package also includes functions for vector and matrix operators (*add, eq, lt...*).

```ts
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as std from 'typegpu/std';

const MAX_OBSTACLES = 4;
const obstacles = root
  .createReadonly(d.arrayOf(d.struct({
    center: d.vec2i,
    size: d.vec2i,
    enabled: d.u32,
  }), MAX_OBSTACLES));

const isInsideObstacle = tgpu.fn([d.i32, d.i32], d.bool)((x, y) => {
  for (let obsIdx = 0; obsIdx < MAX_OBSTACLES; obsIdx++) {
    const obs = obstacles.$[obsIdx];
    if (obs.enabled === 0) {
      continue;
    }
    const minX = std.max(0, obs.center.x - d.i32(obs.size.x / 2));
    const maxX = std.min(gridSize, obs.center.x + d.i32(obs.size.x / 2));
    const minY = std.max(0, obs.center.y - d.i32(obs.size.y / 2));
    const maxY = std.min(gridSize, obs.center.y + d.i32(obs.size.y / 2));
    if (x >= minX && x <= maxX && y >= minY && y <= maxY) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
});
```

```ts
import {
  oklabGamutClip,
  oklabGamutClipAlphaAccess,
  oklabGamutClipSlot,
  oklabToLinearRgb,
  oklabToRgb,
} from '@typegpu/color';
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import { any, cos, floor, gt, lt, mul, select, sin } from 'typegpu/std';

const mainFragment = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({
  in: { uv: d.vec2f },
  out: d.vec4f,
})((input) => {
  const hue = layout.$.uniforms.hue;
  const pos = scaleView(input.uv);
  const lab = d.vec3f(
    pos.y,
    mul(pos.x, d.vec2f(cos(hue), sin(hue))),
  );
  const rgb = oklabToLinearRgb(lab);
  const outOfGamut = any(lt(rgb, d.vec3f(0))) || any(gt(rgb, d.vec3f(1)));

  const clipLab = oklabGamutClipSlot.value(lab);
  const color = oklabToRgb(lab);

  const patternScaled = patternSlot.value(input.uv, clipLab) * 0.1 + 0.9;

  return d.vec4f(select(color, mul(patternScaled, color), outOfGamut), 1);
});
```

TGSL-implemented functions can also be invoked on the CPU, as along as they do not use any GPU-exclusive functionalities, like buffers or textures.
However, the plugin removes the JS implementation from the bundle by default to save space.
So for the TGSL functions to be callable on the CPU, they should be marked with the *"kernel & js"* directive.

## What to keep in mind

* **TGSL limitations** --
For a function to be valid TGSL, it must consist only of supported JS syntax (again, see [tinyest-for-wgsl repository](https://github.com/software-mansion/TypeGPU/blob/release/packages/tinyest-for-wgsl/src/parsers.ts)), possibly including references to bound buffers, constant variables defined outside of the function, other TGSL functions etc.
This means that, for example, `console.log()` calls will not work on the GPU.

* **Differences between JS on the CPU and GPU** --
TGSL is developed to work on the GPU the same as on the CPU as much as possible, 
however because of the fundamental differences between the JavaScript and WGSL languages, it is not guaranteed to always be the case.
Currently the biggest known difference is that vectors (and matrices) are treated as reference types in JavaScript and value types in WGSL.
That is two vectors in JavaScript are never equal to each other, even when they store the same values. 
Also when passing them to functions, they are able to be modified there, unless the user specifically clones the passed argument
(in WGSL vectors are copied by default). When using TGSL on the GPU, the behavior is that of WGSL, not JS, as one would expect.
Therefore some WGSL knowledge is still required, even when opting out for TGSL.

* **.value** --
Objects that have different types on the CPU and on the GPU (like buffers, layouts, slots etc.) need to be accessed via the `value` property in TGSL functions (or the `$` property alias).
This is different from how they appear in WGSL-implemented ones.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const root = await tgpu.init();

const bgColor = root.createUniform(d.vec4f, d.vec4f(0.114, 0.447, 0.941, 1));

const fragmentTgsl = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({ out: d.vec4f })(() => {
  return bgColor.$;
//               ^?
}); 

const fragmentWgsl = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({ out: d.vec4f })`{ 
  return bgColor; 
}
`.$uses({ bgColor });
```

* **Operators** --
JavaScript does not support operator overloading. 
This means that, while you can still use operators for numbers, 
you have to use supplementary functions from `typegpu/std` (*add, mul, eq, lt, ge...*) for operations involving vectors and matrices.

* **When to use TGSL instead of WGSL** --
Writing the code using TGSL has a few significant advantages. 
It allows defining utils only once and using them both as a kernel and host functions,
as well as enables complete syntax highlighting and autocomplete in TypeGPU function definitions, leading to a better developer UX.
However, it sometimes might be better to choose WGSL for certain functions. 
Since JavaScript doesn't support operator overloading, functions including complex matrix operations can be more readable in WGSL.
Also writing WGSL become a necessity whenever TGSL does not support some feature or standard library function quite yet.
Luckily, you don't have to choose on or the other for the entire project. It is possible to mix and match WGSL and TGSL at every step of the way.
