<summary>ðŸ™‹ Why does the API differ from WebGPU?</summary>

The API differs from what can be seen in WebGPU due to a difference in behavior between the two.

The glue code necessary to link WGSL bindings with TypeScript values is not present in TypeGPU,
which does greatly reduce the boilerplate, but requires a different API.

Furthermore, resource management in TypeGPU is, for the most part, automated. When defining a GPU buffer, we
can do so using the `wgsl.buffer` API like so:

```ts
const fooBuffer = wgsl.buffer(f32).$name('foo');
```

This however does not allocate any memory on the GPU, as opposed to the `device.createBuffer` WebGPU
API. Buffers in TypeGPU get allocated eventually, when code using them is executed by a `runtime`.
They then get destroyed when calling `runtime.dispose()`.

<summary>ðŸ™‹ How does TypeGPU differ from Three.js or Babylon.js?</summary>

TypeGPU is a set of primitives for building WebGPU solutions, as opposed to a framework created for a
specific use case like Three.js or Babylon.js. Our hope is that libraries built on top of TypeGPU can interact with
each other with the common language of our primitives, even though they are built with different use
cases in mind (Visualization, AI inference, etc.).

<summary>ðŸ™‹ Which browsers support TypeGPU?</summary>

TypeGPU can be used on any browser that supports WebGPU. The current coverage can be [checked here](https://caniuse.com/webgpu).
Additionally, thanks to [react-native-wgpu](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-webgpu), TypeGPU also works in React Native!
