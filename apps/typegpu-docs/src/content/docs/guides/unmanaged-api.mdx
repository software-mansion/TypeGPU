# Introduction

This guide will show you how to use the unmanaged API to allow for type-safe and convenient read and write operations on WebGPU resources.
We will explore how to adapt existing WebGPU code to use the unmanaged API, and how to use the unmanaged API to create new WebGPU resources.

# What is the unmanaged API?

The unmanaged API is a set of tools for WebGPU that allow you to create and manage typed buffers.
It provides a way to read and write data to and from WebGPU buffers without having to manually translate the values to and from the raw byte arrays that WebGPU uses.
