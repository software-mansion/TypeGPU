TypeGPU CLI (tgpu-cli) is a command-line interface for the TypeGPU library.
It allows you to generate TypeGPU definitions from WGSL shaders.

## Installation

Using npm:

```bash
npm install -g typegpu-cli
```

## Feature overview

- Generate TypeGPU definitions from WGSL shaders
- Continuously watch for changes in WGSL files and update the generated definitions
- Specify input and output using glob patterns
- Choose the output extension and CommonJS or ES module format

## Usage

This section will cover the most common use cases of the TypeGPU CLI and provide short examples.

### Generate TypeGPU definitions for a single WGSL shader file

To generate TypeGPU definitions from a single WGSL shader file, run:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen path/to/shader.wgsl
```

This will generate a TypeScript file with the TypeGPU definitions in the same directory as the shader.
By default, the generated file will have the same name as the shader, with the `.ts` extension.

### Generate TypeGPU definitions for multiple WGSL shader files

TypeGPU CLI supports glob patterns for specifying input paths.
The following command will generate TypeGPU definitions for all WGSL files inside a given directory:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen "path/to/*.wgsl"
```

The generated TypeScript files will have the same names as the shaders, with the `.ts` extension.
To specify a recursive search, use the `**` pattern:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen "path/to/**/*.wgsl"
```

This will generate TypeGPU definitions for all WGSL files inside the `path/to` directory and its subdirectories.

### Specify the output path with the `--output` option

By default, the generated TypeScript files are placed in the same directory as the input shaders.
You can specify a different output path using the `--output` option:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen "path/to/shader.wgsl" --output "different/path/output.ts"
```

This will generate the TypeGPU definitions in the `different/path` directory with the `output.ts` filename.
It also supports glob patterns for specifying the output path:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen "path/to/*.wgsl" --output "output/*.ts"
```

This will generate the TypeGPU definitions in the `output` directory with the same names as the shaders, but with the `.ts` extension.

:::caution
If you use a glob pattern for the input path, specifically `**`, make sure to use the `**` pattern
in the output path as well to preserve the directory structure (*or make sure no conflicts will happen*).
If you don't, all generated files will be placed in the same directory which may lead to name conflicts.

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- src
  - example
    - shader1.wgsl
  - shader1.wgsl
  - shader2.wgsl

</FileTree>

If you run:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen "src/**/*.wgsl" --output "output/*.ts"
```

The script will fail because all generated files will be placed in the `output` directory, and there will be a name conflict between `shader1.ts` and `example/shader1.ts`.

or
```bash
tgpu-cli -h
```

## Example

To generate TypeGPU definitions from a WGSL shader, run:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen path/to/shader.wgsl
```

This will generate a TypeScript file with the TypeGPU definitions in the same directory as the shader.
By default, the generated file will have the same name as the shader, with the `.ts` extension.

You can also specify the input and output using glob patterns:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen "path/to/**/*.wgsl" -o **/*.ts
```

To find out more about the `gen` command, run:

```bash
tgpu-cli gen --help
```It allows you to generate TypeGPU definitions from WGSL shaders.
