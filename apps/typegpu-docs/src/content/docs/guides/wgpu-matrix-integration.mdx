The [wgpu-matrix](https://github.com/greggman/wgpu-matrix) library is a popular tool for WebGPU developers to work with matrices.
It is designed from the ground up to be compatible with WebGPU, and it provides a lot of useful features.

From `wgpu-matrix` version `3.3.0` and `typegpu` version `0.2.0`, it is possible to use TypeGPU primitives inside the `wgpu-matrix` library.

## Using `wgpu-matrix` functions with TypeGPU primitives

Most `wgpu-matrix` functions are designed to accept `BaseArgType` as input arguments. They are defined as follows:

```ts
type BaseArgType = Float32Array | Float64Array | MutableNumberArray
```

where `MutableNumberArray` is defined as:

```ts
interface MutableNumberArray {
	readonly length: number;
	[n: number]: number;
}
```

And since TypeGPU's vector and matrix implement this interface, you can use them directly with those functions.
For example, you can create a vector and normalize it like this:

```ts
import { vec2f } from 'typegpu/data';
import { vec2 } from 'wgpu-matrix';

const v = vec2f(1, 2);
vec2.normalize(v, v);
console.log(v.x); // 0.447..
console.log(v.y); // 0.894..
```

:::note
Since we want to modify the vector in-place, we pass the same vector as both input and dst arguments.
If we didn't, we would get a `Float32Array` without modifying the original vector.

If you wanted to initialize a matrix as an identity matrix, you could do it like this:

```ts
import { mat4x4f } from 'typegpu/data';
import { mat4 } from 'wgpu-matrix';

const m = mat4.identity(mat4x4f()); // returns a mat4x4f

console.log(m[0]); // 1
```

## Migration tips

Since you can use TypeGPU primitives directly with `wgpu-matrix` functions, the migration process is relatively simple.
Let's look at some examples:

### Chained in-place operations on a matrix

If your code creates a matrix and then applies some operations to it in-place, you can use TypeGPU primitives directly:

```diff lang=ts
-const m = mat4.create();
+const m = mat4x4f();
mat4.identity(m);                   // m = identity
mat4.translate(m, [1, 2, 3], m);    // m *= translation([1, 2, 3])
mat4.rotateX(m, Math.PI * 0.5, m);  // m *= rotationX(Math.PI * 0.5)
mat4.scale(m, [1, 2, 3], m);        // m *= scaling([1, 2, 3])
```

### Creating a matrix using a function

If your code creates a matrix using a function, for example:

```ts
const fov = 60 * Math.PI / 180
const aspect = width / height;
const near = 0.1;
const far = 1000;
const perspective = mat4.perspective(fov, aspect, near, far);
```

You can pass a TypeGPU matrix as the destination argument:

```diff lang=ts
+const m = mat4x4f();
const fov = 60 * Math.PI / 180
const aspect = width / height;
const near = 0.1;
const far = 1000;
-const perspective = mat4.perspective(fov, aspect, near, far);
+mat4.perspective(fov, aspect, near, far, m);
```

:::tip
If you didn't remove the `perspective` variable, it would just become an alias for `m`.
This could be useful if you later use that variable and don't want to replace all occurrences.
