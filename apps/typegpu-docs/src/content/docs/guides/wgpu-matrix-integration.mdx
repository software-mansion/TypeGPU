The [wgpu-matrix](https://github.com/greggman/wgpu-matrix) library is a popular tool for WebGPU developers to work with matrices.
It is designed from the ground up to be compatible with WebGPU, and it provides a lot of useful features.

From `wgpu-matrix` version `3.3.0` and `typegpu` version `0.2.0`, it is possible to use TypeGPU primitives inside the `wgpu-matrix` library.
