The [wgpu-matrix](https://github.com/greggman/wgpu-matrix) library is a popular tool for WebGPU developers to work with matrices.
It is designed from the ground up to be compatible with WebGPU, and it provides a lot of useful features.

From `wgpu-matrix` version `3.3.0` and `typegpu` version `0.2.0`, it is possible to use TypeGPU primitives inside the `wgpu-matrix` library.

## Using `wgpu-matrix` functions with TypeGPU primitives

Most `wgpu-matrix` functions are designed to accept `BaseArgType` as input arguments. They are defined as follows:

```ts
type BaseArgType = Float32Array | Float64Array | MutableNumberArray
```

where `MutableNumberArray` is defined as:

```ts
interface MutableNumberArray {
	readonly length: number;
	[n: number]: number;
}
```

And since `typegpu` vector and matrix implement this interface, you can use them directly with `wgpu-matrix` functions.
For example, you can create a `typegpu` vector and normalize it using `wgpu-matrix` functions:

```ts
import { vec2f } from 'typegpu';
import { vec2 } from 'wgpu-matrix';

const v = vec2f(1, 2);
vec2.normalize(v, v);
```
