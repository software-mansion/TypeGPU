## What are Bind Groups and Bind Group Layouts?

If you are already familiar with WebGPU, you might know what bind groups and bind group layouts are. In that case, you can [skip to the next section](#typegpu-approach).
If not, we will briefly explain what they are and provide some useful links for further reading.

### A Quick Overview

A bind group is a collection of resources that are bound to a shader. These resources can be buffers, textures, or samplers.
It's a way to define what resources are available to a shader and how they are accessed. For example, you can create a bind group that contains a buffer and a texture, and then bind it to a shader to use these resources in the shader.
Here is a quick example of how you can create a bind group in WebGPU:

```ts
const bindGroup = device.createBindGroup({
  layout: bindGroupLayout, // We will cover what bind group layouts are later in this guide
  entries: [
    {
      binding: 0, // This number corresponds to the binding number in the shader
      resource: {
        buffer: buffer, // The buffer that we want to bind
      },
    },
    {
      binding: 1,
      resource: {
        texture: textureView, // The view of the texture that we want to bind
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

In this example, we create a bind group that contains a buffer and a texture. We specify the binding number for each resource, which corresponds to the binding number in the shader.
Now, during command encoding, we can assign this bind group to a shader to use these resources.

```ts
renderPass.setBindGroup(0, bindGroup);
```

You probably noticed that in the previous example, we had to specify the layout when creating the bind group.
A bind group layout is a description of the resources that are expected by a shader. It defines the layout of the bind group, including the type of resources and their binding numbers.
You can think of it as a blueprint for creating bind groups. It specifies how the bind group should be structured and what resources it needs to contain.
Here is an example of how you can create a bind group layout that matches the previous example:

```ts
const bindGroupLayout = device.createBindGroupLayout({
  entries: [
    {
      binding: 0,
      visibility: GPUShaderStage.VERTEX, // In what entry point the resource is used
      buffer: {
        // if we don't specify the type, it will default to "uniform"
      },
    },
    {
      binding: 1,
      visibility: GPUShaderStage.FRAGMENT,
      texture: {
        // it will default to sample type of "float" and view dimension of "2d"
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

We can use this layout to create a bind group that matches the resources expected by the shader. It's also necessary to provide a layout when creating a pipeline, so the GPU knows what resources are expected by the shaders.
This can sometimes be automated by passing `auto` to the `descriptor.layout` field when creating a pipeline. This will automatically infer the layout from the shader module.

## TypeGPU approach

TypeGPU provides a more type-safe and ergonomic way to work with bind groups and bind group layouts. The standard WebGPU way of creating bind groups and bind group layouts involves a lot of manual work and is error-prone due to the lack of type checking.
TypeGPU addresses these issues by referencing resources by named keys rather than indices and by providing static type checking when populating bind groups.
We also provide utilities which can generate those definitions from existing `.wgsl` shaders. This means that you can benefit from the type safety and convenience of TypeGPU without having to worry about keeping the definitions in sync with the shader code.

### Typed Bind Group Layouts

First, let's cover how to manually create a typed bind group layout in TypeGPU.
To create a typed bind group layout, you need to call `tgpu.bindGroupLayout` and pass an object that describes the resources that the bind group should contain.
Here is an example of how you can create a typed bind group layout that matches the previous example:

```ts
const bindGroupLayout = tgpu.bindGroupLayout({
  buffer: { uniform: vec3f },
  texture: { texture: 'float' },
});
```

This will create a typed bind group layout that contains a buffer with a `vec3f` type and a texture with a `float` sample type.
The bindings will be automatically assigned based on the order of the resources in the object.

:::tip
This step can be automated by using the *TypeGPU CLI* which can generate the typed bind group layout from the shader code.
It also generates the TypeScript types for the resources, so you can use them in your code.
To learn more about the TypeGPU CLI, check the [TypeGPU CLI guide](/TypeGPU/guides/tgpu-cli).

### Typed Bind Groups

Once you have a typed bind group layout, you can create a typed bind group by **populating** it with the resources.
To do this, you can call the `populate` method on the bind group layout and pass the resources using an object that matches the layout.

Here is an example of how you can create a typed bind group that matches the previous example:

```ts
const bindGroup = bindGroupLayout.populate({
  buffer: buffer,
  texture: textureView,
});
```

This will create a typed bind group that contains a buffer and a texture, matching the resources expected by the shader.
If we accidentally pass the wrong type of resource, the TypeScript compiler will catch the error at compile time.

### WebGPU integration

The bind group created in the previous example cannot be used directly in the WebGPU API. To use it, you need to **unwrap** it to get the underlying WebGPU bind group.
You can do this by calling `root.unwrap(bindGroup)`. This will return the WebGPU bind group that you can use in the WebGPU API.

```ts
const webgpuBindGroup = root.unwrap(bindGroup);

// Now you can use this bind group in the WebGPU API as you would a regular bind group.
renderPass.setBindGroup(0, webgpuBindGroup);
```
