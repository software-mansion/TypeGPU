title: Defining Data Types
description: A guide on how to use the TypeGPU built-in and custom-defined data types.

---


Writing a GPU program usually involves sharing data between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU), in this case between JavaScript and WGSL. Any misalignments or misinterpretations of data can lead to bugs that are hard to debug (No `console.log` on the GPU, I am afraid). While data is strongly typed in WGSL shaders, we give up that type safety completely when writing and reading data in JavaScript/TypeScript. This is precisely what TypeGPU data types help with.

:::note
Complex data types such as structs require particular byte alignment and padding between fields. TypeGPU does this automatically when transforming JS values into binary.

## Examples

Let's look at some examples of defining custom data types using the `typegpu/data` module. If you're familiar with [Zod](https://zod.dev/), then this style of schema definitions may already seem familiar.

```ts
import { struct, f32, vec3i, Parsed } from 'typegpu/data';

const Circle = struct({
  centerPos: vec3i,
  radius: f32,
});

type CircleType = Parsed<typeof Circle>;

const redCircle: CircleType = {
  centerPos: vec3i(2, 4, 0),
  radius: 0.2,
};
```

By defining the `Circle` struct in TypeScript via TypeGPU, in a similar way to how we would in WGSL, we gain access to its TypeScript type definition, which we can use to validate our data values. When reading from or writing data to the GPU, the type of the JavaScript value is inferred automatically, and it's enforced by TypeScript. That's a big improvement to the development process.

Here the `CircleType` evaluates to: 

```ts
type CircleType = {
  centerPos: vec3i;
  radius: number;
}
```

Thanks to that, whenever we mistakenly set or assume a wrong value for an object, we get a type error, avoiding unnecessary debugging afterwards.

```ts
const redCircle: CircleType = {
  // Error: Property 'z' is missing in type 'vec2i' but required in type 'vec3i'.
  centerPos: vec2i(2, 4), 
  radius: 0.2,
};

const redCircle: CircleType = {
  centerPos: vec3i(2, 4, 0), 
  // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
  radius: "0.2",
};

// Error: Property 'radius' is missing in type '{ centerPos: vec3i; }' 
// but required in type '{ centerPos: vec3i; radius: number; }'.
const redCircle: CircleType = {
  centerPos: vec3i(2, 4, 0), 
};

// Error: Property 'rad' does not exist on type '{ centerPos: vec3i; radius: number; }'.
const diam = redCircle.rad * 2;
```

Defined data structures automatically measure and hold information about their memory layout parameters, which is useful for writing to and reading data from the GPU.

```ts
Circle.size // 16
Circle.byteAlignment // 16
```

TypeGPU data types are essential for the library's automated data marshalling capabilities. You can read more about it in the chapter dedicated to `tgpu.writeBuffer`.

## Built-in primitive data types

| constructor | type |  TS type | byte alignment|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| u32 | U32 | number | 4 |
| f32 | F32 | number | 4 |
| i32 | I32 | number | 4 |
| bool | Bool | boolean | 4 |
| vec2u | Vec2u | vec2u | 8 |
| vec2f | Vec2f | vec2f | 8 |
| vec2i | Vec2i | vec2i | 8 |
| vec3u | Vec3u | vec3u | 8 |
| vec3f | Vec3f | vec3f | 8 |
| vec3i | Vec3i | vec3i | 8 |
| vec4u | Vec4u | vec4u | 16 |
| vec4f | Vec4f | vec4f | 16 |
| vec4i | Vec4i | vec4i | 16 |
| mat4d | Mat4f | number[] | 16 |

## Complex data structures

### struct

```ts 
import { struct, vec3u, vec3f, vec4f, bool, Parsed } from 'typegpu/data';

const Boid = struct({
  position: vec3u,
  velocity: vec3f,
  color: vec4f,
  isActive: bool,
});

const boid: Parsed<typeof Boid> = {
  position: vec3u(0, 0, 0),
  velocity: vec3f(1, 0.5, 0.5),
  color: vec4f(1.0, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0),
  isActive: true,
};
```

Each struct has its `byteAlignment` equal to the biggest byteAlignment of its properties. It is also possible to override default byte alignment and size for particular fields via the `align` and `size ` functions.

```ts 
import { struct, vec3u, vec3f, vec4f, bool, align, size } from 'typegpu/data';

const Boid = struct({
  position: align(32, vec3u),
  velocity: vec3f,
  color: vec4f,
  isActive: size(8, bool),
});
```

### arrayOf

To define arrays of known constant length, use the `arrayOf` function. It accepts as arguments the array's elements data type constructor and the length of the array.

```ts
import { arrayOf, f32, Parsed } from 'typegpu/data';

const RecentResultsArray = arrayOf(f32, 4);

// evaluated to number[];
type RecentResultsArrayType = Parsed<typeof RecentResultsArray>;

const recentResults: RecentResultsArrayType = [
    1, 0, 0.5, 20
];

recentResults.shift();
recentResults[3] = -1;
```
