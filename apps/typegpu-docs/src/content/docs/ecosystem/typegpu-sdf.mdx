title: "@typegpu/sdf"

The `@typegpu/sdf` package offers a set of [signed distance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function) utilities for use in TypeGPU and WebGPU projects.

## Example usage

By definition, signed distance functions return a distance from the given point to the boundary of a shape.
For example, the `sdf.sdDisk(position, radius)` returns the signed distance from the `position`, to a circle located at point (0, 0) of radius equal to `radius`.

- `sdf.sdDisk(d.vec2f(1, 0), 1)` is equal to 0.5,
- `sdf.sdDisk(d.vec2f(0.5, 0), 1)` is equal to 0,
- `sdf.sdDisk(d.vec2f(0, 0), 1)` is equal to -0.5.

:::note
Every shape is assumed to be located at position (0, 0).

Position, scale and translation of a shape can be adjusted by applying the inverse transformation to the position argument.
:::

Here is an example of a fragment shader that draws a disk of radius 0.25 on the center of a (assumedly square) canvas:

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as sdf from '@typegpu/sdf';

const mainFragment = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({
  in: { uv: d.vec2f },
  out: d.vec4f,
})(({ uv }) => {
  if (sdf.sdDisk(uv.sub(0.5), 0.25) < 0) {
    return d.vec4f(0, 0, 0, 1);
  }
  return d.vec4f(1, 1, 1, 0);
});
```
