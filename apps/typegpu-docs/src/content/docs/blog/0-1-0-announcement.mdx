title: TypeGPU is here! âŽ¯ v0.1 Release
date: 2024-08-21

import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Today marks our first public release of **TypeGPU**. We are so excited to share our work on this project and
get the feedback necessary to progress in the right direction.

The ["Why TypeGPU?"](/typegpu/why-typegpu) post describes our philosophy and goals for this library.

:::note
Though the 0.1 release
includes a handful of type-safe primitives that can already give a good picture of what using the library will be like, we
ask you to try and look past the current ergonomics of writing WGSL in TypeScript. We are actively working on improving that experience ðŸ™‡.
:::

We have created [Live Examples](/typegpu/examples) to showcase how well TypeGPU scales with complexity. You can edit the code right
in the browser and experiment with the library. You can also of course install the library on your own machine, as described in
the [Getting Started](/typegpu/guides/getting-started) guide.
