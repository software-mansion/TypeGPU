title: Why TypeGPU?
description: TypeGPU is a TypeScript library that allows for building modular and type-safe WebGPU solutions.

## Our philosophy
{/* Our goal is to create a set of primitives that are easy to compose into complex GPU programs, thus
facilitating community collaboration. */}

[WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/) is an amazing addition to the ever increasing collection of WebAPIs, allowing developers
to create highly optimized solutions, most notably for visualization, AI inference and image processing.
We believe that developing a flexible and approachable TypeScript API around it can help in its adoption.

Our goal is to create a set of primitives that are easy to compose into complex GPU programs, thus
facilitating community collaboration. Modules that are built on top of TypeGPU can interact with each other
through the shared language of primitives.


## Roadmap

To achieve our goal, we must complete the following tasks:
<p class="flex gap-2"><Icon name="approve-check" class="text-green-600" /> API for defining WGSL data, and inferring their types in TypeScript.</p>
<p class="flex gap-2"><Icon name="approve-check" class="text-green-600" /> Streamlined data transfer to and from the GPU.</p>
<p class="flex gap-2"><Icon name="approve-check" class="text-green-600" /> Composing code into complex programs.</p>
<p class="flex gap-2"><Icon name="seti:clock" class="text-purple-500" /> Type-safe WGSL.</p>
<p class="flex gap-2"><Icon name="seti:clock" class="text-purple-500" /> Developer tooling.</p>
<p class="flex gap-2"><Icon name="seti:clock" class="text-purple-500" /> Utility modules (pseudo-randomness, image processing, AI inference).</p>
