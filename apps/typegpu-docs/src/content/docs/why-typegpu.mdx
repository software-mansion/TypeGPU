## Our philosophy
{/* Our goal is to create a set of primitives that are easy to compose into complex GPU programs, thus
facilitating community collaboration. */}

[WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/) is an amazing addition to the ever increasing collection of WebAPIs, allowing developers
to create highly optimized solutions, most notably for visualization, AI inference and image processing.
We believe that developing a flexible and approachable TypeScript API around it can help in its adoption.

Our goal is to create a set of primitives that are easy to compose into complex GPU programs, thus
facilitating community collaboration. Modules that are built on top of TypeGPU can interact with each other
through the shared language of primitives.
