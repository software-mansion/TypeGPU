title: Why TypeGPU?
draft: true
---

TypeGPU is a project that aims to provide a type-safe abstraction over WebGPU, one that makes invalid states hard to represent.

## Our philosophy

Compared to use-case driven frameworks like [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) or Babylon.js, TypeGPU acts more like building blocks that can be put together into a framework, or used on their own to enhance existing solutions.
This enables the core library to be minimal, leaving use-case specific functionality to official and third-party modules.

## Is WebGL going to be supported?

Even though WebGPU is a fairly new standard and is not yet supported by every platform, we are betting on it becoming the future of GPU computing on the web. Because of this, we can build
a type-safe API that is low-level enough to not restrict the developer.

## Is it for me?
