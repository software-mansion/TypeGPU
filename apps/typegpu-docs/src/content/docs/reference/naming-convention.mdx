title: Naming Convention

Here's how we recommend naming things in your code.

## Structs & custom data types

We give structs and other custom data types *PascalCase* names.

```ts
const Boid = struct({
  pos: vec2f,
  vel: vec2f,
});

const BoidArray = (n: number) => arrayOf(Boid, n);
```


## Functions

We give tgpu functions *camelCase* names, without any special suffix or prefix. Usually imperative mood, verb-phrase structure (i.e., `"doSomething"`).

```ts
const createBoid = tgpu
  .fn([], Boid)
  .does(() => ({
    pos: vec2f(),
    vel: vec2f(0, 1),
  }));
```

## Buffers

We give buffers *camelCase* names with a `Buffer` suffix.

```ts
const boidsBuffer = root
  .createBuffer(BoidArray(512))
  .$usage('uniform');
```

## Buffer usages

We give buffer usages *camelCase* names with a suffix that corresponds to their usage.

```ts
const boidsUniform = boidsBuffer.as('uniform');
const boidsMutable = boidsBuffer.as('mutable');
const boidsReadonly = boidsBuffer.as('readonly');

const cellsUniform = root.createUniform(Cells);
const cellsMutable = root.createMutable(Cells);
const cellsReadonly = root.createReadonly(Cells);
```
