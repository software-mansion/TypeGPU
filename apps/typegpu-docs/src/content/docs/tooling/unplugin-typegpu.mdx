description: A guide on how to use the optional build plugin for TypeGPU
---

[unplugin-typegpu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unplugin-typegpu) is an optional (but highly recommended) tool for projects using TypeGPU. It hooks into your bundler of choice, and unlocks new features, optimizations and quality-of-life improvements.

The package includes the following functionalities:

- **TGSL functions**

  TypeGPU allows running a subset of JavaScript (which we call TGSL) on the GPU. It is achieved by transpiling JS functions into WGSL.
  This can be done via a Just-In-Time compiler or at build time, using the plugin.
  Transpiling at build time reduces the performance overhead at runtime
  and it is also the only possible approach on React Native, as the function code string is not available during runtime there.

  _unplugin-typegpu_ scans the project files looking for the tgpu function shell implementations.
  It transpiles the JS code into a compact AST format, called [tinyest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinyest).

  When an implementation function is passed directly to the shell creation, the plugin should have no problem identifying and processing it.

  ```ts
  import tgpu from 'typegpu';
  import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

  const add = tgpu['~unstable'].fn([d.u32, d.u32], d.u32)(
    (a, b) => a + b,
  );
  ```

  However, if the implementation function, or the shell, is referenced via a variable, the plugin will not recognize it as TGSL,
  thus to make it work, the function needs to be marked with a `"kernel"` directive.

  ```ts
  const addFn = tgpu['~unstable'].fn([d.u32, d.u32], d.u32);

  const add = addFn((a, b) => {
    'kernel';
    return a + b;
  });
  ```

  ```ts
  const addImpl = (a, b) => {
    'kernel';
    return a + b;
  };

  const add = tgpu['~unstable'].fn([d.u32, d.u32], d.u32)(addImpl);
  ```

  After transpiling the function, the JS implementation is removed from the bundle in order to save space.
  To be able to invoke the function both on GPU and CPU, it needs to be marked with `"kernel & js"` directive;

  ```ts
  const add = tgpu['~unstable'].fn([d.u32, d.u32], d.u32)((a, b) => {
    'kernel & js';
    return a + b;
  });

  add(2, 2);
  ```

  Besides transpiling JS into AST, the plugin also collects external references, so it is not necessary to pass them to the `$uses` method anymore.
  This is not possible when using a JIT transpiler.

- **[WIP] Automatic naming of tgpu objects**

  Naming gpu objects via the `$name` method is very helpful for debugging. Soon it will not be necessary to do that explicitly.
  Instead, the plugin will be able to name the objects based on the variable names that they are assigned to.

:::caution
In order for the plugin to work, the file that is to be transformed needs to import _typegpu_.
Note that unused imports may be automatically removed by bundlers, so make sure this does not happen.

## Installation

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
    ```sh frame=none 
    npm install --save-dev unplugin-typegpu 
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
    ```sh frame=none 
    pnpm add -D unplugin-typegpu 
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
    ```sh frame=none 
    yarn add -D unplugin-typegpu 
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After installing the package, the exported plugin needs to be included in the list of plugins in the bundler config.

## Supported bundlers

The plugin was built using [unplugin](https://unplugin.unjs.io/), which allows it to be used with a variety of bundlers.
Currently the package exports plugins for the following ones: _esbuild_, _farm_, _rolldown_, _rollup_, _rspack_, _vite_, _webpack_.
Apart from the tools supported by _unplugin_, a _babel_ plugin was also created.

:::caution
The _babel_ and _vite_/_rollup_ plugins are the ones that are actively being maintained and tested by the TypeGPU team,
the stability of the other ones may be limited.
:::

- Vite

```js title="vite.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import typegpuPlugin from 'unplugin-typegpu/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [typegpuPlugin()],
});
```

- Babel (React Native)

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = (api) => {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: ['unplugin-typegpu/babel'],
  };
};
```

## Plugin options

```ts
interface Options {
  include?: FilterPattern;
  exclude?: FilterPattern;
  enforce?: 'post' | 'pre' | undefined;
  forceTgpuAlias?: string;
}
```

The plugin accepts the standard `unplugin` options, that make it possible to customize which files are to be processed ([include/exclude](https://rolldown.rs/guide/plugin-development#plugin-hook-filters) patterns),
or [enforce](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#plugin-ordering) the order in which the plugin is run in regards to other plugins.

The custom _forceTgpuAlias_ option allows specifying the name of _tgpu_ object imported from `typegpu`.
It is only useful in a handful of custom scenarios, when the name cannot be retrieved by the plugin automatically from the import statement.
