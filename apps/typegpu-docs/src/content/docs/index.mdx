## Ongoing development!

The library is still under heavy development, and is a little-ways off from being production ready.

Experiment with our <a href="/examples" data-astro-reload>Live Examples</a> to get a feel on how to use TypeGPU, and shape its future
by giving us feedback on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/2gjSqPQc9Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server</a>.

## Main features

We are creating a TypeScript library that enhances the WebGPU API with the ability to modularly compose
WGSL programs, and manage resources in a type-safe and declarative way.

	<Card title="Modular" icon="puzzle">
		Functionality can be spread across files or NPM modules, then combined into a bigger program.
