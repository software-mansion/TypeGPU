## Ongoing development!

The library is still under heavy development, and is a little-ways off from being production ready.

Use the [Playground](/playground) and <a href="/examples" data-astro-reload>Examples</a> to experiment with wigsill, and shape its future
by giving us feedback on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/2gjSqPQc9Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server</a>.
</Card>

## Main features

We are creating a TypeScript library that enhances the WebGPU API with the ability to modularly compose
WGSL programs, and manage resources in a type-safe and declarative way.


<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="More flexibility at zero runtime cost" icon="star">
		Higher-order functions, dependency injection and compile-time execution as a preprocessor step.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Modular" icon="puzzle">
		Functionality can be spread across files or NPM modules, then combined into a bigger program.
	</Card>
